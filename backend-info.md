Currently, this project is focused on the frontend using React. For a full-fledged application, you would typically need a backend to handle data storage, user authentication, and more complex logic.

Given the constraints of the WebContainer environment, which has limitations on native binaries and third-party libraries for Python, the most straightforward backend options within this environment would likely involve using **Node.js** or **Python's standard library**.

- **Node.js**:  You can use Node.js with frameworks like Express.js to create a REST API. For databases, you would need to choose options that don't rely on native binaries, such as lightweight JavaScript-based databases or services that can be accessed via HTTP.

- **Python (Standard Library)**: Python is available, but with the standard library only. You could potentially use Python's built-in modules like `http.server` for a very basic API and file-based storage or SQLite (if available in the standard library and compatible with WebContainer's limitations) for data persistence. However, this would be quite limited for a real-world application.

**For this hackathon project, to keep things simple and within the WebContainer constraints, focusing on the frontend functionality and potentially using browser-based storage (like local storage) might be the most practical approach.** If you need more persistent data storage or backend logic, a simplified Node.js backend could be considered, keeping in mind the limitations on databases and external libraries.

If you have specific backend functionalities in mind, let me know, and we can explore the best way to implement them within the WebContainer environment.
